# Project Requirements Addendum

Based on questions we received regarding the deployed project details, here are a few key points:

1. APIs are not a requirement.
2. Auth is highly suggested - great time to practice using the gem `bcrypt` for password hashing and potentially implementing password validations.
3. Project pitches / approvals will be conducted at 1:00PM Monday.
4. We will conduct daily standups with each team to check for progress and points of concern. 
5. You should be done with MVC functionality by Thursday and can move into styling your application.
6. Project presentations will start at 10:30AM Friday. 

 As laid out in the details of your Mod 2 Final Project document [here](https://learn.co/tracks/web-development-immersive-2-0-module-two/rails/rails-project-mode/guided-module-two-project-for-project-review), this project will touch the full MVC structure of a Rails application.
